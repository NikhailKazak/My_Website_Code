March 11, 2023: 
So it's been a while since my site was 
last available... This issue was primarly cause by a 
discontinuation of Heroku's free tier web hosting. 
That being said, I am back! And the site is better than 
ever. 
To non-programmers, this'll mean nothing, but the 
main difference of this version of the site is that it 
was made using React, whereas the last was just a Node
server and EJS. From this point onwards, the site will 
be hosted via Firebase! 
Anyways, as for what I've been up to, I've recently 
started an internship at Warner Bros. Discovery! 
Honestly, I've really enjoyed my experience so far at 
WBD, as it has not only been a great learning 
experience, but it's also been really fun.
