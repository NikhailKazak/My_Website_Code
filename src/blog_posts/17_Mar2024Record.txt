March 17, 2024

Wow, it's already March, and we're basically a quarter through
2024, hard to believe. For this month, there won't be much of a
blog post, mainly because I'm busy with school - trying to do well
as this is my final term.

Overall, you know looking back it's been an interesting experience.
Because I also had co-op (internships), it's been about 5 years since
I started and they were great for the most part. At this point, I am
actively seeking a full time job, so if any recruiter sees this, feel
free to contact me, and that's basically it for now.
