November 10, 2023

So November's rolled around, 2023 is almost over, and wow,
it's been quite the year. I've honestly accomplished
a lot more than I anticipated and overall I look forward 
to what's to come... I also have some REALLY good news, but
can't say anything yet due to formalities...
But there's news to come!

Now, as for the website, I know updates are few and far
between, but I'm looking to improve it, and get users more 
engaged. So recently I've added some new feature, including
a contact page, analytics and more!
