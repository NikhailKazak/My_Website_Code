Hey Guys, it's June now, and what better time 
than now to make another blog post! The weather 
is immaculate, albeit too hot at times, making it 
an excellent time to catch up on tv and movies.

As I mentioned in my last post, the app I got to work on 
during my CO-OP term, MAX, was due to release exclusively 
in the US on May 23rd, which was about a week ago. And  
although it released with a bit of a bumpy start, it is 
now out in the wild, ready for you (US adiences only atm) 
to stream and catch up on your favourite series.

On an entirely different note now, as also previously 
mentioned, I am taking courses this summer. Specifically,
I'm looking towards completing my minor, so I decided to 
finish that up this summer. As for the courses themselves, 
although they are relatively easy, there is a lot of content,
and assessments, so I do often find myself preoccupied and 
studying.

That being said I was looking use my free a bit more 
productively, so I'll be creating my own youtube series!
Currently I'm in the process of drafting it, but the 
tentative start date should be in the later half of June.
Stay tuned!
