Hello!

If you're seeing this, you're interested to see the code behind my website! Luckily for you, you're in the right place.

This took me a bit of time, as it was my initial attempt at learning React, but it was definitely well worth it. Just like with any project there were some bumps along the way, but I did learn a lot.
